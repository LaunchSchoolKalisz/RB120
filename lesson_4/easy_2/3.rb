How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called? How can you find 
an object's ancestors?

module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end

What is the lookup chain for Orange and HotSauce?
Orange << Taste << Object << Kernel << BasicObject
HotSauce << Taste << Object << Kernel << BasicObject
=end

module Taste
  def flavor(flavor)
    puts "#{flavor}"
  end
end

class Orange
  include Taste
end

class HotSauce
  include Taste
end

p Orange.ancestors

LS Solution

To get the ancestors of a particular class you can ask the class itself and it will tell you 
directly if you call ancestors on it.

For example:

>> HotSauce.ancestors
=> [HotSauce, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

The list of ancestor classes is also called a lookup chain, because Ruby will look for a method 
starting in the first class in the chain (in this case HotSauce) and eventually lookup BasicObject 
if the method is found nowhere in the lookup chain.

If the method appears nowhere in the chain then Ruby will raise a NoMethodError which will tell 
you a matching method can not be found anywhere in the chain.

Keep in mind this is a class method and it will not work if you call this method on an instance of 
a class (unless of course that instance has a method called ancestors).
